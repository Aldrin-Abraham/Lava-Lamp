# Lava Lamp Animation ðŸŽ¯

### Project Description
A fun, interactive lava lamp animation rendered entirely in the browser using CSS and SVGs. The animation mimics the flowing movement of lava, providing a visually captivating effect.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are just too bored staring at static screens. They need something mesmerizing to keep their attention. The world has long been in need of an endless, soothing lava lamp effectâ€”without the mess and the heat.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Weâ€™ve solved the problem by creating a completely virtual lava lamp! Using only CSS for the animation and SVG for the blob shapes, we provide a digital lava lamp experience that runs in any modern browser. No need for heat, wax, or electricityâ€”just pure web magic!
